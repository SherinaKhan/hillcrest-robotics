<h2>The Science Fair</h2>
<p>An event in school where students display their science projects. The robotics team has participated in the science fair numerous times. The team contributing to the science fair is beneficial because their procedure in creating these robots is similar to the scientific method utlizied for majority of projects in the fair. Their approach of using the engineering notebook to record data during their experimentation is a similar tactic used in the scientific method.</p>
<h3>Projects In Science Fair</h3>
<img src="robot 3.jpg" alt="Team" style="width:50%" border="5">
<p>1)One project that occurs annually is the challenge of the coach against the team. This project is when both the team and the coach receive the same task and both must go against each other to accurately complete the task.</p>
<p>2)Two more projects that have been presented in the science fair is the ping pong ball shooter and the dope slap machine.</p>
<h3>Ping Pong Ball Shooter</h3>
<p> The robot is able to pick up a ball and throw it into the target through an individual controlling it.</p>
<h4>Dope Slap Machine</h4>
<p>When a person walks by the machine, it will sense movement and hit the individual.</p>
