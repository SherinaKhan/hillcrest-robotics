<h2>What is Robotics?</h2>
<p>Robotics is a field of engineering that is composed of the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots. Robotics requires knowledge of electronics, mechanics and software, and a variety of other necessary subjects.</p>
<h3>Why Should you Join the Team?</h3>
<p>Robots have become a vital component in defining and shaping our lives. They have changed the structure of society and allowed for safer conditions for labor. Not only have they helped to make conditions safer but made them executed in an efficient manner for everyday needs. Technology is advancing and soon majority of jobs will be fulfilled through robots doing our work in a more precise and effective approach. Joining the robotics team will give a good insight on how to create something that will hevaily benefit soceity in the future. It is also a great introduction into programming and you will be able to see the capabilites robots hold for our future, and that is what makes robotics a valuable branch in the engineering field.</p>
<h4>Why was the Robotics Club Created?</h3>
<p> Technology is advancing and robots are being built in efficient ways that is helping to gradually advance society in regards to how we exeucte tasks. Students were fascinated with the idea of implementing a robotics club into the school when they realized the values of how robots are having a major impact on society in making our lives easier. It was decided to create the club to accommodate to those who were intriguied in robots and wanted to learn how to build their own. Currently the team is being taught by Mr. Aghassi, who has been educating them on the fundamentals of robotics and assigning them their tasks.  .
