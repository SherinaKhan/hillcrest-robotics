<h2>What is the Vex Competition?</h2>
<p>An annual worldwide competition for robotics where teams compete from all over New York. Students from elementary school through univeristy are eligible to compete. The game changes because they set different requirements for the robots each year. For example, one year the requirements for the robot  was that it could not exceed 18 inches in width, length, or height. In addition, at the start of each match was a 15-second autonomous period, where the robot would move without the help of the driver.</p>
